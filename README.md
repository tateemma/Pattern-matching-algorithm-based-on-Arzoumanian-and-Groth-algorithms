# Pattern matching algorithm by Arzoumanian et al (2005) based on the algorithm by Groth (1986).

Short Research Project for my MSc. 
- Investigated whether we could use the pattern matching algorithm for object localization in natural settings such as citrus farms. 
- Investigated different object/feature detection techniques including edge detection and segmentation.
